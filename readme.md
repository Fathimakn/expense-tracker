# Expense Tracker Django Project
A Django-based Expense Tracker app that allows multiple users to register and manage their daily expenses. Users can add, view, and delete expenses with optional categories. Uses SQLite for storage and a `.env` file to securely manage sensitive settings. Categories are stored but not yet tracked or filtered. Designed to be user-friendly and ready for future enhancements like category reports or charts.
